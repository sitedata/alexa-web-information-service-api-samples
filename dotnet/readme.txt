-              Dotnet Sample for Alexa Web Information Service          -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This sample will make a request to the Alexa Web Information Service
using the API user credentials and API plan key.

Tested with .NET Command Line Tools (2.1.403)

1. Subscribe to the Alexa Web Information Service at https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace.
   (Note that you must have an AWS account with a valid credit card.)
2. Register or login to the Alexa Developer Portal and copy the API Key shown on the page.
3. Uncompress the zip file into a working directory.
4. Compile Program.cs:

dotnet build

5. Run:

 dotnet run <Alexa API Account> <API Portal Key> site

 Alexa API Account: The email account used when registering in awis.alexa.com
 API Portal Key: The api key located in the top right corner of awis.alexa.com once you
                 register/login to the API Portal


If you are getting "Not Authorized" messages, you probably have one of the
following problems:

1. Your API registration might not be complete. Return to the AWS Marketplace listing
page and confirm you are subscribed to the product.

2. If you are getting "Request Expired" messages, please check that the date
and time are properly set on your computer.
